#+title: TODOs

* TODO Dynamically change weather symbol based on conditions
  Should probably change the way temperature is extracted to something JSON based rather than just regex when I do this as well.

* TODO Calendar Button in awesome
  Make it so clicking the calendar widget opens thunderbird
** DONE Open thunderbird generally
** TODO Focus thunderbird
** TODO Open calendar Specifically

* TODO Add notification on low battery
  Laptop keeps dying. Need to check for low battery and warn when gets low.
- Will need a flag of some kind to avoid notifications every 30 seconds (or however often it updates)
- Possibly also change background colour of widget to red to highlight it if below 15%?

* TODO Autostart mpd
  Start mpd and mpdris2 on startup

* TODO Theme ncmpcpp
  Make ncmpcpp look more dracula like
